# Practice
Practice project to do with the following: fixing issues with a broken NodeJS server, integrating with MongoDB, taking advantage of docker layer caching, setting up monitoring/metrics, and introducing Kubernetes. 

Working with the following technologies: NodeJS, MongoDB, Prometheus, Docker, and Kubernetes.

## Tasks
1. Fix the `messages` endpoints
2. Fix the `Dockerfile`
3. Add flag for saying whether or not a message is a palindrome.
4. Use MongoDB instead of the in memory DB currently being used.

**BONUS**
1. Implement an endpoint for collecting metrics of the service.
2. Use Docker Swarm or Kubernetes to run 4 instances of the service.


## Progress
The above tasks have all been completed.
